Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please

[Verse 2]
Exactly where I want me, yeah
Underneath your body, yeah
If we take it further, I swear I ain't gonna break
So, baby, come try me
Baby, come find me
Baby, don't wind me up

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I seem a little stressed out
But you're here now, and you're turning me on
I wanna feel a different kinda tension
Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Pretty please
I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

[Pre-Chorus]
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?

[Chorus]
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
When your kisses climb
Oh, you give me sweet relief
Made me feel so pretty
Would you help me out, please?

Lyrics:
[Verse 1]
I feel a little nauseous and my hands are shaking
I guess that means you're close by
My throat is getting dry and my heart is racing
I haven't been by your side
In a minute, but I think about it sometimes
Even though I know it's not so distant
Oh, no, I still wanna reminisce it

[Chorus]
I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a time, what a time, what a time
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a time, what a time, what a time
For you and I
What a time, what a time
For you and I

[Verse 2]
I know we didn't end it like we're supposed to
And now we get a bit tense
I wonder if my mind just leaves out all the bad parts
I know we didn't make sense
I admit it that I think about it sometimes
Even though I know it's not so distant
Oh, no, I still wanna reminisce it

[Chorus]
I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a time, what a time, what a time
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a time, what a time, what a time
For you and I
What a time, what a time
For you and I

[Bridge]
For you and I
For you and I
For you and I
What a time, what a time for you and I
What a time for you and I, yeah
What a time, what a time for you and I

[Chorus]
I think of that night in the park, it was getting dark
And we stayed up for hours
What a lie, what a lie, what a lie
You clinged to my body like you wanted it forever
What a lie, what a lie, what a lie
For you and I
What a lie, what a lie
For you and I
