[Verse 1]
I know it's fake to you
But it was real to me
Tried to stay the same for you
But you changed on me

[PreChrous 1]
You said that you never meant to hurt me
But baby I know this is how it goes
If there is a world where you're not leaving
Then darling I need to know

Lyrics:
[Chorus 1]
Is this really love?
If you don't say the word anymore
If I'm not in love
Let me know when you find what you're looking for
Is this really love?

[Verse 2]
You may have called my bluff
But you've been acting up
Leaving you ain't enough
I just want back my love
You got somebody else to take
My place and did it the wrong way
After all I did for you

[PreChorus 1]
You said that you never meant to hurt me
But baby I know this is how it goes
If there is a world where you're not leaving
Then darling I need to know

[Chorus 2]
Is this really love? (Is this love?)
If you don't say the word anymore
If I'm not in love
Let me know when you find what you're looking for
Is this really love
